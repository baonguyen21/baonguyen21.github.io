      <description>I am an undergraduate electrical engineering student at Oregon State Unversity. I am interested in digital logic design and device physic and wanted to go on the IC design track at OSU. I am also pursuing a minor in Computer Science and Chemistry.
In the past year, I have been working at the OSU OpenSening Lab where I led a team in hardware design to make a DNA sampling machine from scratch.</description>

      <description>For our final funior design project, our team made a solar charger that take in power from a 170W solar panel to charge:
 Sealed Lead-Acid battery Li-ion battery USB-C device with USB PD compliant  The charger follow the charging curve of the battery using constant current, constant voltage, and floating phase. I was in charged of design, fabricate and testing the main charging PCB. I also wrote the Graphical User Interface using Tkinter on Python 3.</description>
